        <p>One of my favorite cities on this trip was Athens. It was breathtaking. I did not have any expectations, but it was beautiful. When we first arrived at the airport, we had a driver waiting for us with a bus so he could take us to lunch, a site, and our hotel.  Our first meal was at this little gyro shop. When we went to pay, the gentleman said, "3 euros," and we all said, "that is it?" Not only was this meal super-cheap, but it was also super delicious. After our lunch break, we went off to see the Temple of Poseidon - the God of the Sea. We got to see this beautiful structure that archaeologists have put back together, though still missing a lot of pieces, we were able to see what it used to look like. The area is 500 feet above sea level; this was strategically done so the sailor could see the white marble from a great distance. <br></br>We also went to other amazing sites, but on the way to the hotel, I left my notebook on the bus, and I have no notes from any of the places because my book was gone. Thankfully, Professor Rick reached out to the driver, and the driver brought my book back to the hotel. Thank God, because I cherish this book. </p>

        <p>Mykonos was my least favorite place we visited, simply because I am not a fan of the beach. I am a fan of doing things and learning. At this point, everyone was tired, and we did a lot of beach/pool time. The water at the beach was stunning; I have never seen anything like it. <br></br>
We ventured off to this island which is a 20-minute boat ride. I can appreciate things from antiquity, but this island was not well maintained, in my opinion, nor did I find it interesting. Although it did have beautiful views and made for great pictures </p>

          Our last stop is Greece was in Rhodes. It was such a fascinating island. We spent a lot of time relaxing here. Our big day was going to Lindos, which a place from antiquity that is surrounded by water. Some of us rode donkeys up and down the mountain. It was spectacular here. After our formal class, we went to a beach that was just wow! The water was crystal clear and cold. We sat here for quite some time. Then it was time to go back to the hotel on their public transportation busses. These busses do not look like typical public transit. They look like coach busses; it was quite interesting. To the right is a picture of one of the bus stops; it almost seemed like a fantasy compared to the public transit here in the United States. </p>
