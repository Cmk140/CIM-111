      <p>After our pleasant visit to Paris, we took a flight to Venice. When we arrived, we had to take a bus and then board a boat called a Vaporetto with all of our stuff; it was quite an experience. We arrived at the hotel, which was super cute and we took time to settle in. We then went to lunch at this little restaurant a few steps away. We were supposed to walk around and have class, but it started to rain. Instead, we had class inside the hotel in this small room. We learned about the history of Venice. We also learned about some of the techniques that were used to build this beautiful city on the water. We then ventured out and saw many different buildings, such as the oldest houses in Venice, and various piazzas. This essentially concluded our first day. Over the next two days, we saw so many different sites. On our free day, my mom and I went over to Murano and saw how glass was made in this museum that is there.

        The Rialto Bridge, which is pictured below with my mom, is a fascinating concept. It has a high bank and is located in the center of the city at the river bend. It has always been the bridge of crossing, stretching 30 meters across. Today's bridge replaced the original bridge that was made out of wood. This bridge is very different from the other bridges in Vencie. It is not a pedestrian bridge, but rather, an occupied bridge with various shops in the middle. </br>  </p>

      <p>After a few days in Venice, we hopped on a train and made our way to Florence. The ride was about three hours if I remember correctly. We started our journey in Florence by eating at All'Antico Vinaio, a sandwich shop. Everyone loved these sandwiches, but I was not a fan. So I took a few steps and went into a pizza shop, and this wonderful pizza man made me a personal pizza in the shape of a heart. We then learned about the architecture of the Uffizi Gallery, and then after some lecture ended up in the Basilica di Santa Maria del Fiore and were given tickets to climb the Duomo. After not knowing what I just got myself into, I made it most of the way up but could not make it to the top. The stairs were way too narrow, and I started to get dizzy, so when we reached an exit point, my mom and I had to leave. This structure is incredible, but I can appreciate it from the ground. </p>

        <p>Ahhh Rome, what a beautiful place. This is the city where we spent the most time. We also took our midterm here... In a hotel lobby. After our final, we went out and learned all about Rome. We went to the Trevi Fountain, which is the most famous in Rome. It is a mighty water fountain. The art on the fountain is baroque, showing the celebration of the arrival of water. It is beautiful; it is mixing natural and man-made elements. You hear the water before you see the fountain.

          <br>
          <br> We also went to Chiesa di San Pietro in Montorio. St. Peter was crucified here. This structure is unique because it is a circular building with a rectangular space. The proportions of the columns which hold the establisher and beam together are perfect. </br></br></p>
