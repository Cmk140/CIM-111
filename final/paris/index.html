      <p>Paris, what a beautiful city. This was the first stop on our grand tour. The first day was exhausting, but we made it through. We started our day by getting off the plane and taking an hour break and then starting our "lecture." The city of Paris was our classroom for the next few days. We learned so much about the beggings of Paris. We were able to look at the building's floor by floor and learn the meaning behind each level of the building. Paris does not have many tall buildings; this is because at the time it was built, elevators were not a thing. We also visited many different public spaces. My personal favorite was Place de Vosges. This park was very symmetrical from the buildings that surrounded it to the layout of the park. After a few days of class, we were given a free day to do whatever we please. Since I brought my mom along for this amazing adventure, we ventured off to Disneyland Paris. We spend the entire day there. That day alone would be a whole story in itself. Being from Flordia it was an absolute MUST!</p>
