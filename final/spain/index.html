          <br></br> <br></br> <br></br> The last and final country we visited was Spain. We went to Madrid. The arcitecture here was stunning. We went on a small walking tour and got to see some of the big parts of the city. The name Madrid comes from Arabic. Here is Madrid the streets curve but the buildings do not. Rather, the building are not in a straight line so they do "curve" with the street. <br></br>

We also visited an arcitecture school about an hour outside of Madrid. After that we had our farwell dinner and I was off to London to mee my dad and spend another week there.</p>
