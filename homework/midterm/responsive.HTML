    <h2>Liza</h2>
    <p>Liza is my neighbor. She is also one of my best friends. She attends Elon University in Elon, North Carolina. She is double majoring in Psychology and Philisophy. I sometimes like her mom Rhonda more than her. Rhonda is the best. She is so kind and caring. Everyone should be more like Rhonda.</p>
